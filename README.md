The analysis of experimental data that have been observed and recorded at different points in time
leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference. The obvious correlation
between adjacent observations in time can considerably restrict the applicability of conventional
statistical methods usually dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are
independent and identically distributed. The set of mathematical approaches that consist of
addressing issues posed by these time correlations is referred to as time series analysis. Time
series analysis is widely used in economics and finance, where we are continually exposed to daily
stock market quotations, monthly unemployment figures, yearly GDPs, and so on. When we have
time-series data (a set of observations recorded at regular time periods) that seemingly fluctuate in
a random fashion over time, we wish to estimate the stochastic process that might have produced
those data. One approach, advocated in the landmark work of Box and Jenkins (1970), develops
a systematic class of models called autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models
to handle time-correlated modeling and forecasting. In this approach, the building of a time
series model involves three steps, namely Identification, Estimation, and Diagnostic checking.
The purpose of this project is to apply Box-Jenkinsâ€™s method to a time series dataset.
